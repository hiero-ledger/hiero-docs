# Compiling Smart Contracts

Compiling a smart contract involves using the contract's source code to generate its [**bytecode**](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#bytecode) and the contract [**Application** **Binary Interface (ABI)**](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#application-binary-interface-abi). The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executes the bytecode to understand and execute the smart contract. Meanwhile, other smart contracts use the ABI to understand how to interact with the deployed contracts on the Hedera network.

**Compiling Solidity**

The compiler for the Solidity programming language is [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/installing-solidity.html) ([Solidity](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#solidity) Compiler). You can use the compiler directly or embedded in IDEs like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en\&optimize=false\&runs=200\&evmVersion=null\&version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js) or tools like Hardhat and Truffle.

## **Smart Contract Bytecode**

Bytecode is the machine-readable language that the EVM uses to execute smart contracts. The compiler analyzes the code, checks for syntax errors, enforces language-specific rules, and generates the corresponding bytecode.

**Example:**

This is the example bytecode output, produced in hexadecimal format, when the [`HelloHedera`](../../tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-your-first-smart-contract.md#hellohedera.sol) smart contract source code is compiled.

## **Smart Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI)**

The ABI is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that represents the interface definition for the smart contract. It specifies function signatures, input parameters, return types, and other relevant details of the contract's interface. The ABI helps developers understand how to interact with the smart contract in their distributed applications.

**Example:**

This is the example ABI output produced when the [`HelloHedera`](../../tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-your-first-smart-contract.md#hellohedera.sol) smart contract is compiled.

```json
"abi": [
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "string",
          "name": "message_",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "constructor"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "name": "get_message",
      "outputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "string",
          "name": "",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "view",
      "type": "function"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "string",
          "name": "message_",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "name": "set_message",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "function"
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Smart Contracts

System smart contracts are Hedera API functionality logic presented at reserved address locations on the EVM network. These addresses contain reserved function selectors. When a deployed contract calls these selectors, they execute as though a corresponding system contract exists on the network. Both system and user-deployed contracts live at the same address. If a contract is redeployed, it gets a new address while the original address retains the old bytecode.

**System Smart Contract Interfaces**

Solidity interfaces provide and define a set of functions that other smart contracts can call. The interfaces for all Hedera systems contracts written in Solidity are maintained in the [`hedera-smart-contracts`](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-smart-contracts) repository.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** The following Solidity examples are _not_ production-ready and are intended solely for instructional purposes to guide developers.
{% endhint %}

The following is a list of available system contracts on Hedera:

### ➡ **Exchange Rate**

The exchange rate contract allows you to convert from tinycents to tinybars and from tinybars to tinycents.

| Contract Address | Source                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

    // Given a value in tinycents (1e-8 US cents or 1e-10 USD), returns the 
    // equivalent value in tinybars (1e-8 HBAR) at the current exchange rate

    // 
    // This rate is a weighted median of the the recent" HBAR-USD exchange 
    // rate on major exchanges, but should _not_ be treated as a live price 
    // oracle! It is important primarily because the network will use it to

    // So a "self-funding" contract can use this rate to compute how much 
    // tinybar its users must send to cover the Hedera fees for the transaction.
    function tinycentsToTinybars(uint256 tinycents) external returns (uint256);

    // 
    // This rate tracks the the HBAR-USD rate on public exchanges, but 
    // should _not_ be treated as a live price oracle! This conversion is
    // less likely to be needed than the above conversion from tinycent to
    // tinybars, but we include it for completeness.
    function tinybarsToTinycents(uint256 tinybars) external returns (uint256);
}

### ➡ **Hedera Token Service**

The Hedera Token Service smart contract precompile provides functions to use the native Hedera Token Service in smart contracts. Tokens created using this method can also be managed using the native Hedera Token Service APIs.

| Contract Address | Source                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
