# Hedera Services Integration with Smart Contracts

The Hedera Service integration with smart contracts allows you to interact with Hedera transactions directly in your Solidity contracts. Just import the supporting Solidity libraries into your contract to start interacting with the other Hedera Services.

The Hedera Service integration currently supports the Hedera Token Service transactions. This integration enables you to interact with tokens on the Hedera network from your smart contract, and supports token associate, dissociate, mint, burn and transfer transactions.

Stay tuned for future releases that will expand support for the remaining HTS transactions!
