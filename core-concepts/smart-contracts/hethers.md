# Hethers

[Hethers](https://github.com/hashgraph/hethers.js/) is a complete and compact library for interacting with the _Hedera Hashgraph_ and more specifically the Smart Contract Service. It is a fork of [The Ethers Project](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) and implements the same program interface as _ethers.js_ with some minor changes.

Please checkout hethers library documentation [here](https://docs.hedera.com/hethers/). &#x20;
